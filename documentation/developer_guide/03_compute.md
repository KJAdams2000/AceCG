# 03 Compute Module Developer Reference

*Updated: 2026-04-23.*

The compute layer is the task-scoped numerical runtime between trajectory/topology I/O and trainers.

It owns:

- `FrameGeometry`
- `MPIComputeEngine`, including `FrameCache` and `TrajectoryCache`; legacy aliases are `FrameObservables` and `TrajectoryObservablesCache`
- the `energy()` and `force()` kernels
- the stateful reducer pipeline in `reducers.py`

It does not own:

- scheduler policy
- workflow orchestration
- trainer tallies across tasks
- optimizer policy

## Core Files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `compute/frame_geometry.py` | Immutable per-frame geometry view |
| `compute/mpi_engine.py` | Task runtime: MPI broadcast, frame extraction, post dispatch, observable cache |
| `compute/energy.py` | `energy()` kernel |
| `compute/force.py` | `force()` kernel |
| `compute/reducers.py` | Stateful pipeline reducers: init / consume / finalize per `step_mode` |
| `compute/registry.py` | `build_default_engine()`, which registers core observables |

---

## Three Stable Public APIs

```python
from AceCG.compute import compute_frame_geometry, energy, force

geom = compute_frame_geometry(positions, box, topology_arrays, interaction_mask=None)

energy_dict = energy(
    geom, forcefield,
    return_value=True,
    return_grad=True,
    return_hessian=False,
    return_grad_outer=False,
)

force_dict = force(
    geom, forcefield,
    return_value=True,
    return_grad=True,
    return_hessian=False,
    return_fm_stats=False,
)
```

All other compute symbols should be treated as internal reducer helpers, parameter helpers, or post-processing bridges, not stable public APIs.

---

## `MPIComputeEngine`

`MPIComputeEngine` is the compute runtime object.

An engine instance owns:

- an MPI communicator, `comm`, which may be `None`
- a registry of observables
- `serial_threshold`, below which frame counts are handled serially

Two stable public entry points:

```python
engine = build_default_engine(comm=comm)

result = engine.compute(
    request,
    frame,                # (frame_id, positions, box, forces)
    topology_arrays,
    forcefield_snapshot,
    frame_weight=1.0,
    ...
)

engine.run_post(spec)
```

`engine.compute()` is local and does not perform MPI:

- accepts a localized `frame` tuple
- builds `FrameGeometry`
- evaluates registered observables according to `request`
- returns a dict, including `frame_observables` when `return_observables=True`

`engine.run_post(spec)` is the scheduled-task boundary:

- rank 0 loads the force-field snapshot, MDAnalysis Universe, and `TopologyArrays`
- shared context is broadcast to all ranks
- each rank receives a contiguous frame chunk or a split of `discrete_ids`
- one-pass steps call the reducer pipeline
- MPI reduce -> rank 0 finalize -> pickle output
- see [04_mpi_runtime.md](04_mpi_runtime.md)

---

## Observable Cache: `FrameCache` and `TrajectoryCache`

`run_post()` supports a per-frame geometry digest cache for downstream analysis:

```python
spec["collect_observables"] = True
spec["gather_observables"] = True
spec["observables_output_file"] = "cache.pkl"
```

| Class | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `FrameCache` | `compute/mpi_engine.py` | Lightweight geometry digest for one frame: pair distances, bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, box |
| `TrajectoryCache` | `compute/mpi_engine.py` | Collection of `FrameCache` objects for a trajectory |
| `geometry_to_observables()` | `compute/mpi_engine.py` | Extracts a `FrameCache` from `FrameGeometry` |

The old names `FrameObservables` and `TrajectoryObservablesCache` remain as compatibility aliases. New code and documentation should prefer `FrameCache` and `TrajectoryCache`.

This mechanism lets `analysis/rdf.py` access already-computed geometry without rereading the trajectory.

---

## Reducer Pipeline

`reducers.py` provides a five-function pipeline for each `step_mode`:

```python
state = init_*_state(step)
req = request_*(step)
consume_*_frame(state, frame_result)
partials = local_partials_*(state)
plan = reduce_plan_*(step)
result = finalize_*_root(state)
```

Current reducer families:

| `step_mode` | Init function |
|---|---|
| `fm` | `init_fm_state` |
| `rem` / `cdrem` | `init_rem_state` |
| `cdfm_zbx` | `init_cdfm_zbx_state` |
| `rdf` | Uses `analysis.rdf.interaction_distributions()` directly and does not enter the one-pass pipeline |

`cdfm_y_eff` has been deprecated. `y_eff` is now computed during the rank-0 preprocessing phase of `cdfm_zbx` from each replica's init configuration and paired `.forces.npy` reference-force file:

```text
y_eff = y_ref - f_theta_cg_only(R_init)
```

The mask is temporarily switched to CG-only during this calculation and restored afterward.

Reducer conventions:

- reducers perform local math and call `engine.compute()` for observables
- reducers do not read trajectories, perform MPI broadcast, or write output files
- MPI reduce is handled uniformly by `run_post()`

## Leaf Step Output Contracts

All scheduled compute outputs are pickle files. Each payload is a top-level dict whose values are ndarrays and simple scalars.

### `step_mode="rem"` / `"cdrem"`

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `energy_grad_avg` | Weighted average `<dU/dtheta>` |
| `n_frames` | Number of contributing frames |
| `weight_sum` | Total frame weight |
| `d2U_avg` | Optional weighted-average Hessian |
| `grad_outer_avg` | Optional gradient outer-product average |
| `energy_grad_frame` | Optional per-frame gradient stack |

### `step_mode="fm"`

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `JtJ` | Normalized weighted FM normal matrix |
| `Jty` | Normalized weighted FM right-hand-side vector |
| `y_sumsq` | Normalized weighted target-force squared norm |
| `Jtf` | Normalized weighted `J^T f` |
| `f_sumsq` | Normalized weighted model-force squared norm |
| `fty` | Normalized weighted `f^T y` |
| `nframe` | Number of contributing frames |
| `weight_sum` | Total frame weight |
| `n_atoms_obs` | Number of observed atoms per frame |

### `step_mode="cdfm_zbx"`

Required spec keys:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `init_force_path` | Reference-force `.npy` paired with this replica init configuration; shape `(n_real, 3)` or `(3*n_real,)` |
| `init_frame_id` | Init-configuration frame id for `FrameCache.frame_idx`; defaults to 0 |
| `mode` | `"direct"` or `"reinforce"` |
| `beta` | Temperature factor for reinforce mode; optional for direct mode |

Output payload:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `grad_direct` | Direct gradient contribution |
| `grad_reinforce` | REINFORCE gradient contribution |
| `sse` | Sum of squared error |
| `obs_rows` | Observation-row count |
| `n_samples` | Sample count |
| `rmse` | `sqrt(sse / obs_rows)` |

---

## `multi` Mode

When `spec["steps"]` contains multiple steps, all one-pass steps share a single trajectory traversal:

```text
run_post(spec with multiple steps):
  prepare shared context once
  extract local frames once
  for each frame:
    result = engine.compute(...)
    consume_step0_frame(state0, result)
    consume_step1_frame(state1, result)
    ...
  for each step:
    comm.reduce(local_partials)
    finalize_*_root()
    pickle output
```

Contract:

- all one-pass steps in `steps` must share the same trajectory, topology, and context
- if different trajectory or geometry context is needed, use a separate task
- `rdf` steps do not enter the one-pass pipeline; they run separately after one-pass steps finish

---

## Frame-Weight Semantics

`spec["frame_weight"]` always means task-local trajectory weights consumed inside the scheduled task.

It applies to all `step_mode` values.

It is not a cross-task weight such as CDREM `x_weight` or CDFM `x_weight`. Those belong to trainer batch schemas and are handled by workflows and trainers.

---

## Allowed Workflow Access Patterns

Do:

- build a task spec and pass it to `MPIComputeEngine.run_post()`
- use `multi` when several leaf reductions share the same trajectory, topology, and context
- consume pickle payloads to assemble trainer or solver batches
- treat `engine.compute()` only as a local observable helper

Do not:

- call reducers directly as the primary production API
- own MPI broadcast, MPI reduction, trajectory slicing, or cache lifetime in workflow code
- reimplement compute-side accumulation in workflow code just because legacy helper functions exist

---

## Required Task Spec Keys

|---|---|
| `work_dir` | Task working directory |
| `forcefield_path` | Force-field pickle path |
| `topology` | Topology file path |
| `trajectory` | Trajectory path as `str`, or path list as `list[str]` |
| `steps` | List of steps; each step must have `step_mode` and `output_file` |
